## Unit 5 Project: Public API Requests

**Summary:** This project fetches employee data from a [public API](https://randomuser.me/) and displays that data in a user-friendly gallery.  

Users can click on an employee's card to open up a modal and view more details about that employee. While in the modal view, users can use the next and previous buttons(or left & right arrow keys) to toggle through the employees. 

In addition, there is a search bar at the top right of the gallery view that allows users to search for employees by name.
